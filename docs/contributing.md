# Contributing to TimeLord

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TimeLord! We welcome contributions from the community to help make this project even better. As someone with fresh eyes on the project, you can provide valuable insights, feedback, and improvements that can benefit everyone. This guide outlines the contribution process and provides guidelines to help you get started. Let's save time together!

## Modularity

TimeLord is designed with a strong emphasis on modularity. This allows for easy extensibility and customization. If you would like to contribute to TimeLord, we encourage you to follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions align with the project's modularity principles:

1. **Encapsulate functionality**: When adding new features or making changes, strive to encapsulate the functionality in a modular and reusable manner. This helps maintain a clean and organized codebase.

2. **Follow the Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module or component should have a single responsibility. Avoid creating monolithic components that handle multiple unrelated tasks. Instead break down the functionality into smaller, focused modules, and compose them as needed into the more complex abstractions you need.

3. **Use clear interfaces**: When designing modules, define clear interfaces that clearly communicate the expected inputs, outputs, and behavior. This promotes loose coupling and makes it easier for others to understand and extend your code.

4. **Document your modules**: Provide clear and concise documentation for each module, including usage examples and any dependencies. This helps other contributors understand how to use and extend your modules effectively.

## Code Style and Guidelines

Currently we do not have a set of refined coding styles or guidelines. However, we encourage you to follow the following guidelines:
1. **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent formatting throughout the codebase. This includes indentation, spacing, and line breaks. Consider using a code formatter to automate this process.
2. **Descriptive Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. This makes the code easier to read and understand. A great example from the codebase is the TerminalMemory class, which is a memory class for the terminal.
3. **Documentation over comments**: While in some cases comments are pertinent, we encourage you to write or suggest edits to the documentation instead. This makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand as new people typically have a better time reading documentation than code.

## Code Review

All contributions to TimeLord go through a code review process to ensure the quality and maintainability of the codebase. Here are some guidelines to follow during the code review process:

1. **Readability**: Make sure your code is easy to read and understand. Use meaningful variable and function names, and follow consistent formatting and indentation.

2. **Modularity**: Ensure that your code follows the modularity principles mentioned earlier. Encapsulate functionality in reusable modules and components.

3. **Performance**: Optimize your code for performance and token efficiency whenever possible. Avoid unnecessary computations or resource-intensive operations.

4. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages. Use appropriate exception handling techniques and consider edge cases.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests to validate the correctness of your code. Cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure robustness.

6. **Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly, including inline comments and high-level explanations. This helps other developers understand your code and its purpose.

## Communication

Effective communication is essential for successful collaboration. Here are some guidelines to follow when communicating with other contributors:

1. **Be respectful**: Treat others with respect and professionalism. Avoid personal attacks or offensive language.

2. **Be constructive**: Provide constructive feedback and suggestions. Focus on the code and ideas, not the person.

3. **Be responsive**: Respond to comments and questions in a timely manner. Keep the conversation active and engage with other contributors.

4. **Ask for help**: If you need assistance or have questions, don't hesitate to ask for help. The community is here to support each other.

## License

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

3. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes.

4. **Make your changes**: Make the necessary changes to the codebase. Follow the guidelines mentioned earlier for code style and modularity.

5. **Test your changes**: Test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected. Write unit tests if necessary to validate your changes.

6. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes to the branch you created. Use clear and descriptive commit messages to explain your changes.

7. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

8. **Create a pull request**: Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and explain the purpose of the pull request.

9. **Code review**: Your pull request will go through a code review process. Address any feedback or comments provided by the reviewers.

10. **Merge your changes**: Once your pull request is approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository. Congratulations on your contribution!

## Areas to Contribute

Here are some areas where you can contribute to TimeLord:
1. **Documentation**: Improve the project documentation by adding more examples, tutorials, or explanations. As someone new to the project you know exactly what was difficult to understand, share and improve this knowledge by contributing to the documentation.

2. **Bug Fixes**: Identify and fix bugs in the codebase. Look for issues labeled as "bug" in the issue tracker and submit fixes for them.

3. **Feature Requests**: Implement new features or enhancements to the project. Look for feature requests in the issue tracker and submit your proposals.

4. **Code Refactoring**: Refactor existing code to improve readability, performance, or modularity. Look for areas of the codebase that can be optimized and submit refactoring proposals.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests to validate the correctness of the code. Cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure robustness. We also have a special form of tests called prompt tests, which are specific prompts we expect the agent system to be able to solve either one shot or in a multi-turn conversation, besides documentation improving the prompt tests is a great way to contribute.

6. **Model Integration**: Integrate new models into the project. We are always looking for new models to integrate into the project. If you have a model that you think would be a good fit for the project, feel free to submit a proposal for how to effectively integrate it, and we will be happy to help you with the integration process.

7. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the codebase for performance and token efficiency. Token efficiency is a key aspect of this project. The goal of this project is to save people time, and the quicker the agent can solve the prompt the better. So optimally we would like the cheapest model that has the highest throughput to be able to solve the most amount of prompts in the least amount of time.

## Conclusion

Thank you for considering contributing to TimeLord! Your contributions are valuable and help improve the project for everyone. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers. Happy coding!
